Biological invasions continually threaten our economy and environment, with examples ranging from coronavirus through to the recently arrived polyphagous shothole borer in WA, the continuing westward march of QFly, the spread of myrtle rust, and the ongoing march of cane toads.  How do we control these species?  Can we stop them spreading?  Can we eradicate them? This project develops new tools for controlling, containing, and eradicating invasive populations.  

Although the project will develop tools that can be deployed against well-established pest species, the primary focus will be on rapid response to newly arrived pests.  In coming years, remote sensor networks will provide dramatic efficiency improvements in biosecurity surveillance.  We will increasingly be able to detect unwanted arrivals early, at a time when containment and eradication are more feasible.  This project looks to put us on the front foot for rapid response to these detections.  The project will develop new tools for containment and eradication, and leverages new developments in modelling, analytics, and biotechnology to do so.  These tools will form important capability for WA (and Australian) Biosecurity.

## Progress

This project commenced in July 2023.  Ben and Brenton are busy forming up the project with industry and government partners.  They will be recruiting a postdoctoral fellow, four new PhD students, and several Hons/Masters in the near future. Please get in touch with Ben or Brenton if you are interested in joining the team!
